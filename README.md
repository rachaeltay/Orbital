## Project Scope
Web app to allow users to view and create events, and save them to a planner

## Problem motivation
Students looking to get in touch with the latest happenings will now have a one-stop shop with listings of all events happening. No longer will they need to trawl through multiple websites and look through obscure listings. Users can also send invites via social media platforms to coordinate with other like-minded individuals. Up-and-coming events now have a platform to showcase their offerings and boost their presence.

## Proposed Features and Technologies
