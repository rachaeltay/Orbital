## Project Scope
Mobile app to allow users to view and locate events in Singapore

A map-based mobile app designed to show events in Singapore that allows users to purview events currently happening, and sign up for events. Users can also host their own events and invite others. The app updates with real time to ensure that all events are updated.

## Problem motivation
Singaporeans looking to get in touch with the latest happenings will now have a one-stop shop with listings of all events happening. No longer will they need to trawl through multiple websites and look through obscure listings. Users can also send invites through the app to coordinate with other users. Up-and-coming events now have a platform to showcase their offerings and boost their local presence.

## Proposed Features and Technologies 
- Use of Google Maps or other maps API will be the mainstay of the app | to allow geo-mapping of events
- Stored using SQL 
- Users will be able to sign up and maintain accounts with the use of Google Firebase

Level of Achievement: Gemini
